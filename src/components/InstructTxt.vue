    In this study, you will take the role of a chief executive named
    <b>Alex Carter</b>, who works at a petrochemical company called
    <b>Anneon</b>.<br /><br />

    As a top executive, you are responsible for making strategic and financial
    decisions to keep the business running as profitably as possible.
    <br /><br />

    These decisions can range from foreign investment deals, finding new
    business partners, to changing local business operations.<br /><br />

    Your task is to process e-mails that you received as Alex Carter.<br />
    To do so, you will see a mock inbox like this:<br /><br />

    <img src="../assets/ss_inbox.png" width="100%" /><br /><br />

    Assume that all e-mails are unread.<br/>
    
    The inbox has similar functionalities as what you typically would find in an
    actual e-mail inbox.<br /><br />
    
    You process an e-mail by clicking on an e-mail in the list on the left.<br />
    The full e-mail will then be displayed on the right. <br />
    You then <b>choose one of the available actions</b> for the selected e-mail
    from the bar displayed above the e-mails.<br /><br />

    <ul>
      <li><b>Reply</b>: allows you to reply to the sender of the e-mail.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Forward</b>: forward the e-mail to your executive assistant (EA), so
        the EA can take care of it. You do not need to type an extra message for
        this action.
      </li>
      <li><b>Archive</b>: move the e-mail to an archive.</li>
      <li><b>Delete</b>: delete the e-mail.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Junk</b>: report the e-mail as junk and move it to the junk folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Process the e-mails as you would normally do, with your role as an executive
    in mind.<br /><br />
    You are free to use any text formatting when writing replies.<br/><br/>
    
    Note that all links in e-mails have
    been disabled and that this task should not take more than 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />

    When you are done processing all e-mails, click "DONE":<br /><br />
