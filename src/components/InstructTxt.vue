      Today is <b>Wednesday, August 13, 2022</b>. You were on vacation last week
      and did not check your emails. You have already arrived at the office at
      <b>7:00 a.m.</b> to complete the tasks at hand.<br /><br />

      <b>You have 40 minutes</b> to process the emails you have received, as you
      will no longer be in the office from <b>7:40 a.m.</b> onwards, because you
      have a number of other appointments. You will not be able to reach any of
      your co-workers or business partners, as the official start of work is not
      until <b>8:00 a.m.</b>. However, you can send a message to your secretary,
      <b>Mr. Amin</b>.<br /><br />

      The order in which you process them is entirely up to you. Your task is to
      choose what you think is the <b>best applicable action for each email.</b
