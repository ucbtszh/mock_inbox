      Today is <b>Monday, August 15, 2022</b>. You were on vacation last week and did not check your emails. You have already arrived at the office at <b>7:00 a.m.</b> to complete the tasks at hand. <b>You have 40 minutes</b> to process the emails you have received, as you will no longer be in the office from <b>7:40 a.m.</b> onwards, because you have a number of other appointments.
