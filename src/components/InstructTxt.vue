    Imagine you are a chief executive named
    <b>Alex Carter</b>, who works at a petrochemical company called
    <b>Anneon</b>.<br /><br />

    As a top executive, you are responsible for making strategic and financial
    decisions to keep the business running as profitably as possible.
    <br /><br />

    These decisions can range from foreign investment deals, finding new
    business partners, to changing local business operations.<br /><br />

    Now imagine that it is Wednesday 12 October 2022.<br />
    You were at an event all day, so you could not process your e-mails
    before.<br />
    You open your inbox and find 47 new e-mails from the day.<br />
    Your task is to process them all in your role as Alex Carter.<br /><br />

    You will see a mock inbox like this:<br /><br />

    <img src="../assets/ss_inbox.png" width="100%" /><br /><br />

    The inbox has similar functionalities as what you typically would find in an
    actual e-mail inbox:<br /><br />

    <ul>
      <li><b>Reply</b>: reply to the sender of the e-mail.</li>
      <li><b>Forward</b>: forward the e-mail.</li>
      <li><b>Delete</b>: delete the e-mail.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Keep in inbox</b>: do not take action on the e-mail now, leave it in
        the inbox.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    To process an e-mail:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Click on an e-mail in the list on the left. The full e-mail will be
        displayed on the right.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Choose one of the available actions</b> for the selected e-mail from
        the bar displayed above the e-mails.
      </li>
      <li>
        A secondary bar with buttons will appear. Click on the button that best
        represents your reason to reply to, forward, delete or keep the e-mail.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you chose to reply, forward or delete the e-mail, the e-mail will
        disappear.
      </li>
      <li>
        A confirmation of your processing action will be shown in the bottom of
        the screen.
      </li>
      <li><b>When you have processed all e-mails, click "DONE":</b></li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <img src="../assets/ss_done.png" width="100%" /><br /><br />

    Process the e-mails with your role as an executive in mind.<br /><br />

    Note that all links in e-mails have been disabled and that this task should
    not take more than 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />
