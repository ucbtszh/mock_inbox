    Imagine that you are a renowned professor named Alex Carter in the field of health informatics, working at University of London (UOL).<br /><br />
    In this study, you will see a mock inbox with 47 e-mails adapted from actual e-mails received by academics.<br/>
    Your task is to process these e-mails as if you received them in your role of Prof. Carter.<br /><br/>

    <img src="../assets/ss_inbox_control.png" width="100%" /><br /><br />

    The inbox has similar functionalities as what you typically would find in an
    actual e-mail inbox.<br />
    To process an e-mail, click on an e-mail in the list on the left.<br />
    The full e-mail will be displayed on the right. <br /><br />

    All available actions that you can take with the selected e-mail are displayed in the bar above
    the e-mails.<br /><br />

    <ul>
      <li><b>Reply</b>: allows you to reply to the sender of the e-mail.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Forward</b>: forward the e-mail to your executive assistant (EA), so
        the EA can take care of it. You do not need to type an extra message
        for this action.
      </li>
      <li><b>Archive</b>: move the e-mail to an archive.</li>
      <li><b>Delete</b>: delete the e-mail.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Junk</b>: report the e-mail as junk and move it to the junk
        folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Your task is to choose what you think is the <b>best applicable action</b> for each
    e-mail.<br />
    Please note that all links in e-mails have been disabled and that this task should not take more than 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />

    When you are done processing all e-mails, click "DONE":<br /><br />
