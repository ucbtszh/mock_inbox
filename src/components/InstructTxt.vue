    In this exercise, you will be asked to prioritize various tasks, initiate actions, process 
    information, make decisions, and coordinate deadlines in a meaningful way. You will 
    be assessed on how you analyze information, process it organizationally and take
    measures and make decisions within a given time frame.<br /><br/>

    Please put yourself in the following situation: <br />  <br />

    PTCL (Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd.) has established a new division in
    Lahore in April 2022 to build the 5G network in Pakistan. You are A. Durrani (first
    name is not specified for gender neutrality) and you are the head of this department. 
    You oversee the organization and implementation of all necessary processes and
    you are therefore responsible for the success of the project. <br />  <br />

    the employees relevant to you. <br/> <br/>

    Today is Monday, May 4 2023. You were on Eid vacation last week and did not check
    your mails. You have already arrived at the office at 7:00 a.m. to complete the tasks
    at hand. You have <strong>40 minutes</strong> to process the mails you have received, as you will no
    longer be in the office from 7.40 a.m. onwards, because you have a number of other
    appointments. You will not be able to reach any of your co-workers or business
    partners, as the official start of work is not until 8:00. However, you can leave written
    messages for your secretary, Ms. Amin. <br/> <br/>

    The mails in your inbox are numbered to make it easier to keep them apart. The
    order in which you process them is entirely up to you. <strong>Please process all mails!
    Make a note of what your actions would be for each mail. During the
    discussion of the results, we would like to know how you evaluate the mails in
    detail, what conclusions you draw and what measures you take.</strong> <br /> <br/>

    Note: In order to carry out the exercise, some restrictions must be made. There will
    be no opportunity for consultation. <strong> The processing time is limited to 40 minutes.
    You will be able to handle all the problem cases on your own. </strong> The processing is
    possible without detailed expert knowledge.
