        Dear A. Jones,<br/><br/>

We have learned that you are planning to erect a number of transmission towers in the Portland area in the coming months. We would like to respectfully inform you that a large number of local people are suspicious of this project. Rumors are circulating that 5G radiation is harmful to humans and also to animals. Frankly, none of us would like to have a radiating transmission tower on our doorstep and we believe you can understand that. The Portland Neighborhood Association is eager for all citizens of Portland to be seen and heard by ATCL and for their concerns to be acknowledged. We would be as happy to receive an official statement from you as we would be to have a representative from ATCL meet with our association. Please let us know if and when you would be interested in this regard.<br/><br/>

With kind regards<br/><br/>

Portland Neighborhood Association
