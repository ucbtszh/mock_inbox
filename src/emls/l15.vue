    Please see below e-mail from an interested intern. Let me know if you want

    -------------------- <br /><br />
    Dear Sir/Madam,<br /><br />

    I am writing to express my strong interest in the Operations Research
    Internship position at ATCL, as advertised on your company's website. As a
    highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong academic
    background in operations research and a passion for solving complex
    problems, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your
    team.<br /><br />

    I am currently pursuing an MSc in Econometrics at MIT, where I have gained a
    solid foundation in operations research methodologies and statistical
    analysis. My coursework has equipped me with the skills necessary to analyze
    and optimize various business processes, enabling me to make data-driven
    decisions that improve overall efficiency.<br /><br />

    During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a
    practical setting through Unilever. In this role, I collaborated with a
    cross-functional team to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain and
    developed optimization models that resulted in a 20% reduction in
    operational costs. This experience not only enhanced my analytical and
    problem-solving abilities but also honed my communication and teamwork
    skills.<br /><br />

    I am particularly drawn to ATCL because of your commitment to innovation in
    networking technology, especially with the exciting prospect of building the
    American 5G network. Your company's reputation for leveraging cutting-edge
    technologies to address complex challenges aligns with my own professional
    aspirations. I am eager to bring my analytical skills, enthusiasm, and fresh
    perspectives to ATCL, contributing to your ongoing success.<br /><br />

    I am impressed by ATCL's dedication to fostering a collaborative and dynamic
    work environment, and I am confident that my academic background, coupled
    with my hands-on experience, makes me a strong candidate for the Operations
    Research Internship position.<br /><br />

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity
    to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of ATCL. I am
    available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached
    via email at lloyd_palmer99@gmail.com.<br /><br />

    Sincerely,<br />
    Lloyd Palmer
