    Dear A. Jones,<br /><br />

    Please sign the following testimonial for our intern Joseph, who will soon
    be leaving.<br /><br />

    Joseph Skipper, born June 14, 1995 in Boston, completed an internship in
    [our department] during the period May 01, 2022 to September 01, 2022.<br /><br />

    Mr. Skipper has always performed the tasks assigned to him to our complete
    satisfaction and has met our expectations in an outstanding manner. He has
    always been a reliable, committed and flexible employee with a very high
    sense of responsibility. In addition, his professional skills can be
    described as above average. His ability to work in a team also makes him a
    popular trainee with supervisors and employees alike.<br /><br />

    We would like to thank Mr. Skipper for the consistently good cooperation and
    his commitment, which went beyond the requirements. For the further course
    of his studies and his professional life we wish him all the best, good luck
    and success.<br /><br />
