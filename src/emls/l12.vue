    Dear A. Jones,<br /><br />

    My name is Marvi Robeson.I am a reporter from Bang Media Group working for
    GEO News channel. My team and I are in Portland on August 18, shooting a
    report on ATCL and in particular your relatively young department. It's
    about how you and your department will tackle the proclaimed 5G project, how
    much of it is already in place, and what the next steps are specifically. It
    would be wonderful if you, as the head of the department, could take the
    time for an interview. We were planning to arrive at your site around 8:45
    am and join you and your staff for a few hours. Please let me know in
    advance how you feel about this.<br /><br />

    Kind regards<br/>
    Marvi Robeson<br/><br/><br/>
