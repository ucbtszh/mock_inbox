	Hello,<br/><br/>

	Tomorrow's seminar will be held by Dr. Michael Veale on The use and (potential) abuse of privacy-preserving infrastructures.<br/><br/>
	
	Date & Time: 12 October 2021, 4PM<br/>
	Zoom Link: <a href="https://UOL.zoom.us/j/9710537890?pwd=U0daQk9VWW05MkVHUmMrY1ABYzo6QA09" target="_blank">https://UOL.zoom.us/j/9710537890?pwd=U0daQk9VWW05MkVHUmMrY1ABYzo6QA09</a><br/><br/>
	
	Abstract:<br/>
	Privacy-preserving systems are moving from theory to headlines — often without as much experiences in “practice” as we might want. Of particular interest in this accelerated deployment is their collision with the platform economy, enclosed databases and operating systems. In this talk, I will draw connections between concerns that come at this intersection of privacy-preserving technology and the power to run a protocol, drawing on recent developments such as the DP-3T contact tracing system that led to Apple and Google’s Exposure Notification system (which I was a co-author of) and high profile efforts such as Google’s Privacy Sandbox. Privacy alone can’t take us where we need to go, particularly when it is understood narrowly as information leakage or confidentiality. I’ll start to paint a picture — and start an interactive discussion, I hope — about where privacy’s ability to curtail power ends, and what researchers need to consider beyond their existing paradigms of technology development and design.<br/><br/>
