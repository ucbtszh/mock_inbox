    <h2>Registration for EUREKA Summer School now open:</h2>

    UOL is part of an exciting initiative, The EUREKA Institute of Translational Medicine, which offers innovative courses for early career researchers. Translational medicine (TM) encompasses the continuum from identifying an idea to its development into new therapies for human diseases. By enabling people to develop research through this continuum, we will move critical scientific insights into tangible benefits for patients. EUREKA courses aim to tackle this challenge through training the new generation of researchers to understand how the overcome the intrinsic barriers to successful translational research. For more information on EUREKA see <a href="http://eurekainstitute.org/">http://eurekainstitute.org/</a><br/><br/>
        
    The EUREKA summer school course is held specifically for highly motivated Msc and PhD students who have an interest in TM.  Registration is now open for the course held in Utrecht, The Netherlands, June 9th – 13th 2022, closing on January 21st 2022.<br/><br/>
    
    The summer school’s overarching aim is the empowerment of aspiring clinical/translational scientists through:<br/><br/>
    
    Scientific literacy, understanding how science works<br/>
    
    Understanding the translational pathway<br/>
    
    Improving complementary and leadership skills<br/><br/>
