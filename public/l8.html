Alex,<br><br>

I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the
room number. FYI, our goal is to discuss the expert path (best answers) for
the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding
storage.<br><br>

Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?<br><br>

Thank you for your help.<br>
Mery<br><br><br>
