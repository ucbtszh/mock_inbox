    Dear all,<br/><br/>
    Many of you will now know that all UOL staff now have access to an institutional Zoom account.<br/>
    If using Zoom please use your own account rather than the departmental one that was purchased as an emergency contingency by management back in March. Should the login details be changed for this account, you won’t be able to access.<br/><br/>
    Details for how to set one up or migrate an existing account are here – https://liveuolac.sharepoint.com/sites/Zoom/SitePages/Setting-up-an-account.aspx<br/>
    The resource centre has further details including participation guidance https://wiki.uol.ac.uk/display/ZRC/Zoom+Resource+Centre<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Best wishes<br/>
    Graham
