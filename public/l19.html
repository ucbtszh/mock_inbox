Dear Mr. Carter:<br><br>

Thank you for your email.<br>
Yes, recruiting season is now in full swing.  I am now waiting to hear from<br>
Ms. Chenee Franklin, hoping to secure an interview.  Eva was very helpful<br>
and informative; through her I learned a good deal about Anneon's trading<br>
businesses.<br>
Once scheduled for an interview, I would appreciate it if we could talk over<br>
the phone at your convenience.<br><br>

Again, thank you, and I will keep you updated.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

Gad Caspy<br><br>

Just following up to see if the recruiting season has started and to make<br>
sure everything is going okay.  If you need anything, just say the word.<br><br>

   Gad:<br>
   Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva<br>
   referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. <br>
   I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.<br>
   I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program<br>
   in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an<br>
   offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate<br>
   recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk<br>
   via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good<br>
   opportunities here.<br><br>
