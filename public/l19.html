    Dear Prof Carter,<br/><br/>

    Via this e-mail I would like to connect with you regarding your research on informatics.<br/>
    I recently started my PhD at the University of London. My research concerns people's use of health informatics data.<br/>
    Through my reading thus far I came across many of your research articles and am interested in testing to what extent your theory on informatics extrapolates to my research. Would you be interested in having a chat about this sometime this or next week?<br/>
    If so, please let me know what times would suit you best.<br/><br/>
    
    I look forward to your response.<br/><br/><br/>
    
    
    Best wishes,<br/>
    Joanna Chmiel
