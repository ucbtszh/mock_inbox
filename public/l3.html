With our MSc Informatics module starting next week, we are still in desperate need of volunteers to help run journal clubs.  This counts as two hours of teaching, and there is no marking involved. Journal clubs are every week on Thursday (2-4 pm) and Friday (11am-1pm).  You can pick any paper (old or new), two students will prepare a powerpoint presentation and discuss the paper, and your role is just to help manage the discussion (bring up points the students have overlooked, etc.).  Running a journal club is open to faculty, postdocs, and phd students.<br /><br />

To sign up, please click on the journal club tab, after using the link here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/5tyrhUEFa0UdI4cjaZOwZjIFv4RGcoQR404A1Ieo9hHQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/5tyrhUEFa0UdI4cjaZOwZjIFv4RGcoQR404A1Ieo9hHQ/edit?usp=sharing</a>. Please indicate your chosen paper one week before your journal club (at the bottom of the google sheet page). Alternatively if its easier, you can email me a preferred time slot.<br /><br />
    
Please let me know if you have any questions.<br /><br />
