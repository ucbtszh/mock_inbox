      I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label
      platform deal. We have had several meetings since I first presented the
      idea to you all. Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World
      Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade
      Center collapse. They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but
      their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are
      inaccessible for the time being. They are up and running out of a Jersey
      City location with some back up capability.<br /><br />

      To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco
      branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's
      customers. Anneon would provide transactable prices to the site with wider
      spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes. Refco customers would
      transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would
      sleeve the transactions to Anneon allowing us to consolidate our credit
      risk to a singular credit, Refco. The products contemplated include
      various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural
      gas, and electricity. Revenue would come to Anneon in the form of license
      fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the
      additional volume create by the wider margin products. Revenue would come
      to Refco in the form of transaction fees. Refco has a similar arrangement
      in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform
      for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.<br /><br />

      Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is
      comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly. Refco
      advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by
      them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute
      derivatives. So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts
      they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal. Credit is reviewing
      the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their
      visit.<br /><br />

      Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or comments
      and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your
      feedback.<br /><br />

      Regards<br /><br />
