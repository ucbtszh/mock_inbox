      Dear colleagues,<br/><br/>

      Many thanks for the warm welcome that I have had from colleagues over the last few days. 
       Thank you for helping me settle in. 
       I am looking forward to working with you over the coming months and hopefully beyond.<br/><br/>
      
      I need to share information with you that is being widely disseminated across UOL Faculties.<br/><br/>
      
      The Union has notified UOL that it is asking its members to participate in industrial action in support of the union’s national trade dispute regarding proposed changes to the USS Pension Scheme. Initially this will consist of a number of days’ strike action.<br/><br/>      
       
      
      UOL have also announced Action Short of a Strike (ASOS).<br/><br/>
      
       
      
      UOL members can only take the forms of action specified on their ballot paper – strike action and action short of a strike as follows:<br/>
      
      - refusing to rearrange lectures / classes cancelled due to strike action;<br/>
      
      - refusing to undertake voluntary duties;<br/>
      
      - not covering for absent colleagues;<br/>
      
      - and “working to contract”.<br/><br/>
      
       
      
      The ballot paper did not include a marking boycott, so that form of action could only be taken if there is a further ballot on escalated forms of industrial action.<br/><br/>
      
       
      
      Any member of staff who takes strike action or action short of a strike will be refusing to carry out their contractual duties and will therefore be committing a breach of their contract of employment. This is set out in UOL Council's Statement on pay negotiations and dispute resolution, which also applies to the current pension dispute.<br/><br/>
      
       
      
      The Senior Management Team (SMT) have agreed unanimously that 100% of pay will be withheld from staff for any days when they are taking part in full strike action. Pay will be deducted at a rate of 1/365ths (pro rata) in these circumstances. This is now the norm in the sector for calculating the pay for a day’s work. UOL also reserves the right to deduct up to 100% for partial performance of duties, in terms of ASOS, whilst taking into account the impact on the university's performance and/or commitment to its students.
      
      Any staff taking strike action or action short of a strike to record this on an online system.  Staff will have a day’s pay deducted for each day of strike action and UOL reserves the right to deduct up to 100% of pay for other days where staff are recorded as having taken action short of a strike (ASOS). Pay deductions will be paid into the Student Hardship Fund.
      
      <i> "UOL teaching may be affected by industrial action<br/>      
      UOL is one of 61 universities across the UK that will likely be affected by strike action in late February and March. The action has been called by the University and College Union (UCU) to support the union’s dispute about proposed changes to the USS Pension Scheme, to which many staff who teach and support teaching belong. Industrial action by members of UCU could include cancelling classes or lectures, not undertaking voluntary duties and not covering for absent colleagues. This may cause some disruption to teaching at UOL and we will do all we can to make sure that students are not disadvantaged by this disruption. <br/>
      UOL is allowed to ask staff whether they will be participating in strike action or ASOS.  Staff are required to answer truthfully.  Staff do not have to provide this information in advance. If you do plan to go on strike and wish to share that information please email me directly <br/><br/>      
    </i>
      
      Staff participating in strike action or ASOS must use the online reporting system for staff (staff portal) to declare that they are doing so and enter each date of action separately.  Staff will be able to see their own declarations and whether information has been entered by their division, institute or department.  Staff can register a dispute of this information on the staff portal if they disagree. This information will be used to enact payroll deductions. Pay withheld will not be repaid when the action is concluded.<br/><br/>
      
       
      
      Best regards,<br/>
