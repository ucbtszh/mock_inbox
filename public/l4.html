    Dear Alex,<br/><br/>

    I do apologise for the delay in responding to your email below. <br/>
    I have been away for the past few weeks and I am just catching up on emails now.<br/> 
    If you still require assistance with your query below, please do get in touch with Nadine Logan (DTP Manager). <br/>
    She should be able to assist you with your questions regarding student financing.<br/><br/>
    
    I hope this is still helpful.<br/><br/>
     
    
    Best wishes,<br/>
    Nafisa Buckley<br/><br/><br/>
