	Dear Prof. Carter,<br/><br/>

	I was browsing UOL's staff for experts on the reasons people communicate and thought I may ask my question to you.<br/>
	I recently started my PhD on the topic of deception detection in online environments. For this I am wondering whether there is a well-established framework or taxonomy that specifies the reasons for why people communicate (intents). One theory I found for instance is Halliday's 7 functions of language in child development.<br/>
	Do you know of any other theories from a linguistic/communication science point of view that describe such fundamental intents/functions of communication?<br/>
	I don't know if you are the best person to ask, given your research in informatics; if you know anyone else whom I should ask, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know.<br/><br/>
	
	Thank you very much in advance.<br/><br/><br/>
	
	
	Best wishes,<br/>
	David Roth
