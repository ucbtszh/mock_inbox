    ### Revise and Resubmit<br/><br/>
    
    CHI 2022 introduces the Revise and Resubmit process. Please read our blog post as well as the webpage to explain the details of our review process.<br/>
    https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchi2022.acm.org%2F&amp;data=e80528a45fb945608d988d2ce94%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C637691261260451872%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=oODbPfmLNUeJeMamiDfLvhwke94S5UyMy4zaoaUgGa4%3D&amp;reserved=0<br/>
    https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchi2022.acm.org%2ngb945608d988d2ce94%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=aqLlPF%2FRsqrcYWKt898v35QGu%2BUjN79D6aF%2FP2TpWKA%3D&amp;reserved=0<br/><br/>
    
    We expect that most papers will either be accepted or rejected during the first round of the process. Only a few papers ~7-10% of the total number of papers submitted should be marked as Revise and Resubmit, (only those with a clear and explicit path for revision). If the authors address those explicit concerns to the satisfaction of the external reviewers and assigned ACs, those papers will subsequently be accepted.<br/><br/>
    
    Please note that you will be asked to re-review if the paper is invited to Revise and Resubmit, and authors have submitted their revisions (deadline for resubmission: 1/10/2022, deadline for re-review: 01/29/2022)<br/><br/>
    
    Revise and Resubmit for CHI is implemented on a limited time frame. In particular, this means that reviewers are not expected to provide a second full review but should quickly evaluate changes which will be provided by the authors.  This includes: improving presentation, rewriting a discussion, moderate reframing, providing more details, expanding a bit on existing analyses, or shortening a paper. However, changes that could significantly change the contribution, such as running an additional study, are considered too significant.<br/><br/><br/>
    
    
    ### Paper Length<br/><br/>
    
    There is no explicit paper-length limit on submissions, however papers should be of length commensurate with their contributions. An overly long paper may be rejected if the contribution is considered to be too small. Papers can be marked for revision if there’s explicit agreement about how the paper can be shortened.<br/><br/><br/>
    
    
    ### Important dates<br/><br/>
    
       For the first round:<br/>
           - Review due for 2AC and external reviewers: 10/29/2021<br/>
           - Reviews released to authors: 11/18/2021<br/><br/>
    
       For the second round:<br/>
           - Resubmission due from authors: 1/10/2022<br/>
           - Re-reviews from 2AC and external reviewers due: 2/1/2022<br/>
           - Re-reviews released to authors: 2/10/2022<br/><br/><br/>
    
    
    ### Review policy<br/><br/>
    
    Please consider the Guide to Reviewing Papers (https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchi2022.acm.org%2Ffod722ae80528a45fb945608d988d2ce94%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C637691261260451872%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=YSM5DhAWKgTLgNeP2YrvZyYrJEARnsa8f5ENjudAFtw%3D&amp;reserved=0) as you work on reviews.<br/>
    <br/> 
    All papers are considered confidential and you should not publicly discuss the content of the paper. Even if you have reviewed the previous version of this submission at previous CHI or other venues, please review it as if it is a new submission.<br/><br/>
    
    There is an optional field in the submission form that authors may use to describe revisions from any previously submitted papers. Please check this field before finalizing your review.<br/><br/>
    
    Thank you for considering this request.<br/><br/><br/>
    
    
    ### Accessibility<br/><br/>
    
    CHI 2022 strives to be an accessible conference from all parts of the process, including the reviewing stage. If you require accessibility support for reviewing a paper, please do not hesitate to notify the 1AC. For example, if you find a PDF without alt text for images included. The 1AC will work with the accessibility chairs to provide you with a paper in an accessible form.
