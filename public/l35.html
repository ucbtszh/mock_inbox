    Dear all,<br/><br/>

 

    There are a number of people who are turning up at 12 Queen Square without asking for permission first<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    If you wish to visit 12 Queen Square, even to collect a package, please can you send an email to me first<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    12 Queen Square are following the same attendance procedures as we have a strict attendance log<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Many thanks,<br/><br/>
