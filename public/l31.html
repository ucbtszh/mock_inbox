    Dear Prof Carter,<br/><br/>


    I am a current student in the Informatics MSc programme at UOL to which you gave a fascinating lecture on model-based learning. Following the lecture, I looked into the current research opportunities within your lab and would be very eager to be a part of any ongoing research. Thus, I was wondering if there are any spots left within your lab.  <br/><br/>
     
    Due to the current situation, I would be able to start a dry project and come into the lab after easter, if that would be preferred. <br/><br/>
    
    Please let me know if this would be possible or if you would require supporting information which I will happily provide.<br/><br/>

    I look forward to hearing your response,<br/><br/>
    
    Kind regards,<br/>
    
    Natalia Krawczykowski
