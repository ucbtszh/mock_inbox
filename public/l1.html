    Dear Prof. Carter,<br /><br />
    
    Via this e-mail I haha  haha would like to ask if you would have some time in the upcoming two weeks to chat about your research and possibilities for PhD supervision.<br /><br />
    I obtained my MSc in Health Informatics with Distinction two months ago and am very interested in the research you do on statistical methods to apply in healthcare. I am currently in the process of deciding what career path I want to take and exploring what industrial and PhD options there are within the broader themes of (applied) research in technology, health and education. I have intermediate experience with (electrophysiological) data processing, visualization and statistical analyses in R and SPSS and want to develop a deeper understanding of how to apply statistics on big data in healthcare. Hence, I would be delighted to know more about your current/upcoming research and meet you in person to talk about this.<br /><br />
    I will be in London in the next two weeks. Would any time within this period suit you? Please let me know if this would be possible.<br /><br />
    
    I look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />
     
    Best regards,<br />
    Sarah McAllen
