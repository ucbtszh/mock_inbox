Naomi,<br><br>

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.<br>
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.<br>
Vishal joined our group in October. He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.<br>
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category. I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.<br><br>

Call me with questions.(0203843704)<br><br>
