    Dear DGTs<br/><br/>

 

    The PhD student in the Faculty have already been given this link to join a seminar I am running today for all first year research students (or those that are still writing their literature review).<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    The session is about how to research material and organise a literature review. Please can you remind the students the seminar is today from 11.00-12.00 (link to Teams below).<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Thanks<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Olga
