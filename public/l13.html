    Dear All<br/><br/>

 

    My heart felt thanks for your lovely messages and gift as I leave you and my EIS family<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    It has been a privilege to meet you and to work with you all and I wish you well as the year gets underway.   <br/><br/>
    
     
    
    A fond farewell to all of you beavering away with research and academic pursuits. I am so in awe of what you do. <br/><br/>
    
    You are all truly amazing.  <br/><br/>
    
    
    With best wishes and fond regards<br/><br/>
    
    Pauline <br/><br/><br/>
