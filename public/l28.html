    Dear Alex,<br/><br/>

    Via this e-mail I would like to ask if you could allow me to audit course COMP0056, as it looks very interesting to me. I just started as a PhD student in the Informatics program (no mandatory courses).<br/>
    Please let me know if this is possible.<br/><br/>
    
    
    Best wishes,<br/>
    Jacob
