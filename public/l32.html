    Dear Alex,<br/><br/>

 
I hope all is well with you?<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    We’re hosting a hackathon as part of one of our research projects on careers in informatics. We wonder whether any of your team/colleagues at UCL – staff, students, CDT - might be interested in taking part? Please find the details below for circulation, or we’d be happy to send if you have mailing lists or people in mind.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Best wishes,<br/>
    
     
    
    Joy<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    
     
    
     
    
<mark><b>8-10 February 2022 - AMoC Hackathon</b></mark><br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Bristol Informatics Group is hosting a biocrime hackathon. Groups from select institutions are invited to 
    create teams of 4 to tackle a three-day intensive hackathon. 
    Teams will compete against each other on two data-driven biocrime investigation tasks exploiting timestamped 
    textual observations of underground biocrime activities.<br/><br/>
    
    The AMoC project (Advanced Modelling of Biocrime Careers) aims to tackle financially-motivated biocrime 
    on Darknet Markets by gaining a better understanding of the offenders, their motives, interventions effective 
    at disrupting their activities, different roles within their networks and how these evolve over time.
     Key outputs from the project will contribute to a software toolkit designed to assist law enforcement in their b
     iocrime investigations. <br/><br/>   
    
    The Hackathon will begin with a call to arms from colleagues (expert panel), situating the tasks in the real world. 
    Teams will then be given access to the datasets and challenged to undertake the following tasks:<br/><br/>
    
    <b>1. Longitudinal visualisation:</b> Create an innovative visualisation representing the datasets over time, 
    with particular attention to how significant events might affect the nature of posting on the forums.<br/><br/>
    <b>2. Author re-identification:</b>  Train a competitive classifier to re-identify individuals' accounts across 
    different forums, drawing on stylometric and temporal features.<br/><br/>
    
    Teams will be asked to give a short (5 min) presentation and create a short report on their solution to both tasks. 
    These will be judged by the expert panel of biocrime and machine learning researchers. 
    The winning team will receive a prize of £1,000 (4 x £250 Amazon vouchers).<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    All teams' solutions will be credited and published as part of a shared task report. <br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Submit your team's details through the Eventbrite page here or email BCSG Enquiries directly.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Good Luck!<br/><br/>
