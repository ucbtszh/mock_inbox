    Dear colleagues<br/><br/>
 

    Although you’re likely to be already aware of this event, we wanted to send across a formal invitation to attend the <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">UOL/Wellcome Trust Translational Partnership Award (WTTPA) Launch.</a><br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Taking place on Tuesday 21st January, 3pm-5pm (+ networking until 7pm), the event will announce the initiatives surrounding our Therapeutic Innovation Networks (TINs); this will include funding calls, workshops and training for 2022.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    There will also be an opening address from Chair of the Wellcome Trust, Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller (previous Director General of MI5), along with translational case studies from researchers across the university and at various stages of their careers.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">View the full agenda.</a><br/><br/>
    
     
    
    We are especially encouraging early career researchers to attend in order to make them aware of the support available for translation at UCL – Including the TINs. The invite will also be disseminated to the TINs community.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    If you would like to attend, <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">please register here</a>.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    We hope to see you there!<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Best wishes,<br/>
    
    Chloe<br/><br/>
