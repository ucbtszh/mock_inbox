    Dear Professor Carter<br/><br/>
 
    I hope this email finds you well.<br/><br/>
     
    I’m writing from Perseco, a leader in the bioinformatics space, where I look after our EMEA Communications programme. I was referred to you from the NCSC website as part of my research for health machine learning competition we’re running in March, and I think it would be great to have the university involved.<br/><br/>
     
    We’ll be hosting the ‘Hacker Games’ contest, which invites university students (undergraduates and postgraduates welcome) to take part in a two-week coding challenge with select universities across the UK and US. Participants will have the opportunity to complete as many challenges as possible in our Data Labs platform, where they’ll learn how to create machine learning pipelines for health data parsing.<br/><br/>
     
    There will be prizes available for the individual contestants, and all participating universities will receive complimentary access to Perseco software for educational purposes. The winning university will also receive a charitable donation. <br/><br/>
     
    We would love to invite UOL to take part and think it would be a great opportunity to bring health insights to life!<br/><br/>
     
    Would you have some time this week for a call to discuss so I can provide more information and get your feedback on the idea?<br/><br/>
     
    In the meantime, please feel free to check out the complimentary Community Edition of Data Labs to get a sense of how our labs work.<br/><br/>
     
    I look forward to hearing from you.<br/><br/>
     
    Best wishes<br/>
    Shane
