			https://myaccount.ucl.ac.uk/<br />
	(We suggest that you copy or type this address into your browser rather<br />
	than clicking on it).<br /><br />
	
	If your password has not been changed within the next 30 days, it will<br />
	be automatically reset. If you have already registered your mobile phone<br />
	number with MyAccount you will be able to reset an expired or forgotten<br />
	password online at https://myaccount.ucl.ac.uk/<br /><br />
