The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.<br><br>

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-<br><br>

<b>(i) Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)</b>				To be forwarded to Louise	<br>
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.<br>
	The current restart date is January 21, 2011 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2011.	<br>
<b>(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2011)</b>						To be forwarded to Faith Killen <br>
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)<br>
<b>(iii)	Seating Plans</b>								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate<br>
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Anneon South building.<br>
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2011.<br>
<b>(iv)	Due Diligence</b><br>
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.<br><br>

I would ask that both Alex and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.<br><br>

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.<br><br>

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.<br><br>

Happy New Year<br><br>

Louise
