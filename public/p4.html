Dear Carter,<br><br>

This is a personal letter directed to you and I request that it be treated as such. I'm Paul Heywood, a
Private attorney based here in Adelaide , South Australia. Honestly it will be my humble pleasure if
we can work together.<br><br>

I would like you to act as the next of kin to my deceased client Engr. Marco Carter, your country
citizen who made a deposit of US$18,700,000.00 ($18.7 Million USD) with a Bank here in Australia.
He died in a car accident without any registered next of kin. Several efforts were made to find his
extended family without success.<br><br>

I have received an official letter from the bank suggesting a likely proceeding for confiscation of
the Fund in line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited the sum of $18.7
Million Dollars. According to the Government Law here, the bank has issued me 21 working days as
the deceased attorney to present the deceased heir or have the account confiscated and closed as
an unclaimed bill, if nobody applies to claim the fund.<br><br>

My proposition to you is to present you to the bank as the Next of kin to my late client so that the
bank will pay this $18.7 Million USD to you as named beneficiary so that we can share the amount
on a mutually agreed percentage of 45% for me, 45% for you, then 10% for donation to the
Orphanage homes<br><br>

I don't want you to worry about the legal part of this deal as all legal documents to back up your
claim will be provided by me. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us to see this
transaction through. I will also guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law here or in your country.<br><br>

I will need the following information from you If you find interest in this transactions so that I can
give you comprehensive details on how to proceed;<br><br>

Your Full Name:-------------<br>
Address: ------------------<br>
Your Age:-------------------------<br>
Occupation:-----------------------------<br>
Your Telephone, and Mobile for Communication Purpose:--------------------<br><br>

Your immediate response will be highly appreciated.<br><br>
