    Dear all,<br/><br/>

    This Friday at 9:30am in the seminar room, Gary Wong from McGill University will give a short talk about his research on electrosensory processing.<br/><br/>
    
    Gary uses electrophysiology and pharmacology to study the contribution of different receptors or channels to the encoding of natural sensory stimuli.<br/><br/>
    
    This talk should be interesting to many at the EIS given the strong parallels between electrosensation and mechanosensation/hearing in the other species that we study.<br/><br/>
    
    Best wishes,<br/><br/>
    
    Don
