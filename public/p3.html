    Dear Prof Carter, <br/><br/>
    
    We are very honored to invite you to participate in our Research Mentorship Program. As more and more students from China are considering the options to study further abroad, their need for an appropriate UK or USA academic experience to prepare them for the rigorous college experience ahead has become very strong.<br/><br/>
    
    The details are as follows,<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Format:</b> ten/twenty/customized hours coaching for each student privately. 1 or 2 hours each week and usually on weekends.<br/>
    <b>Platform:</b> Zoom Online<br/>
    <b>Student:</b> International high school students or college students<br/>
    <b>Compensation:</b> 1000 USD / 10 hours session; 2,000 USD/ 20 hours session;<br/>
<b>Goal:</b> To mentor the student to produce a project/paper on the topic<br/><br/>
    
    Please respond to this email if you are interested in this opportunity. Thank you very much! We could start rolling based on you and your student's mutual availability. We anticipate you could mentor 10~20 students yearly thus the return will be USD10,000 to 20,000.<br/>
    Please let me know your availability if you are interested.<br/><br/>
