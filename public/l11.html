        The Anneon deal at Elba Island amounts to a sendoout capacity of 160mmcf/d for 17 years. This will be tough to
        fill as the majority of existing supply exceeds the max heat rate-I would look for Anneon to get out of this in
        some way. Anneon is currently having discussions with El Paso as to whether this contract goes into effect Dec
        1st 2022 or Jan 1st 2023. Elba Island has recently said that they will be running in Q4 although many still
        doubt it.<br><br>

        Attached is a file that lists the terminals, their capacity owners, facility owners, expansion plans, and supply
        situation. Let me know if you have any more questions.
