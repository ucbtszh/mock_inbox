    Hi all,<br/>

    Quick question/beg…..I am hoping to get some money for a research project (I will know by mid Dec), but I am going to need a few RAs to work for a two month period (mid-Jan to mid-March) full time.<br/>
    
    They would be paid a daily rate and it would be on a research project on electronic patient records so they would get named on the report/papers and would get the experience.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Do you know anyone who just finished a MSc/PhD, or is happy to get involved mid-PhD who might be interested?<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    It is all remote – so from their home, and it’s basic data crunching, no major skills or experience required.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Thanks in advance.<br/><br/>
    
     
    
    Jamie
