  Dear All,<br/><br/>

 

  I have not received the EIS credit card, therefore, can you please check your desks and see if the credit card is with one of you.<br/><br/>
  
   
  
  If I have not received the card by 4.30 today I will need to cancel card and wait for a new card.<br/><br/>
  
   
  
  The new card can take up to 2 weeks to arrive.<br/><br/>
