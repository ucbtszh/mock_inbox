    Hello,<br/><br/>

    Today’s seminar will be held by Chelsea Komlo on Introducing FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures.<br/><br/>
    
    Date & Time: 8 Oct 2021, 2PM<br/><br/>
    
    Abstract: FROST is an improved threshold Schnorr signature scheme that<br/>
    allows for an optimization from a two-round signing protocol into a<br/>
    single-round protocol with preprocessing. FROST improves upon prior<br/>
    constructions as it is secure against forgery attacks which are<br/>
    demonstrated to be viable against similar schemes in the literature.<br/><br/>
    
    In this talk, we will introduce FROST and the motivations for its<br/>
    design. We will review the security model under which FROST is secure,<br/>
    and how this security model compares to practical deployments of<br/>
    threshold signatures. We will discuss how FROST is compatible with<br/>
    existing protocols such as those that require EdDSA compatibility, as<br/>
    well as next steps for FROST to be deployed and standardized.<br/><br/>
    
    Bio: Chelsea Komlo has nearly a decade of engineering experience and is<br/>
    a lead author on cryptographic designs ranging from multi-party<br/>
    signature schemes to post-quantum primitives with applications to secure<br/>
    messaging. She currently is completing her Ph.D at the University of<br/>
    Waterloo in the Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Lab, and is a<br/>
    Principal Technical Advisor and Researcher for the Zcash Foundation.<br/>
    Chelsea also serves on the board of directors for the Tor Project and on<br/>
    the Tor Research Safety Bard.<br/><br/>
    
    Best regards,<br/>
